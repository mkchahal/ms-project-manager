## Description 
Ms. Project Manager is a simple project management app. It is very inituitive to use with data stored in MongoDB and served through GraphQL. Now I understand the hype for GraphQL. The setup took me some time but using it on the front-end side was a piece of cake. Also, the provided tool to test endpoint - GraphiQL was extremely helpful.
